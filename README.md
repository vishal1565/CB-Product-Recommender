# Welcome, hack-o-holics, to the 2023 TDI Global Hackathon
## About your hackathon environment
Your hackathon environment consists of four components:
1. A GCP project (https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=hack-team-hack-o-holics)
2. This GitHub repository (https://github.com/db-hackathon/hack-o-holics)
3. A Terraform Cloud workspace (https://app.terraform.io/app/db-hackathon-2023/workspaces/hack-team-hack-o-holics)
4. A namespace in a shared RedHat Openshift 4.13 cluster (XXX)

You have considerable interactive access to your GCP project.
Using the GitHub repository and the Terraform Cloud workspace are entirely optional.

> **Note**
> This README content may be changed or overwritten by the hackathon organisors during the event. If you intend to create documentation please house it in a separate file.

## Access Issues
If you have any issues accessing any aspect of the hackathon environment, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/db-hackathon/support/issues/new/choose), 
or ask a colleague to do so.

## [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=hack-team-hack-o-holics)
### First log-in
To log in to the GCP Cloud Console:
1. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com.
2. Sign out if you're already signed in.
3. On the first form (headed, "Sign in to continue to Google Cloud Platform") enter your hackathon user ID then click "Next".
   1. To derive your hackathon user ID, take the personal email address you signed up with, substitute the "@" with "." and append "@dbtechhackathon.com".
   2. For example, foo@bar.com becomes foo.bar.com@dbtechhackathon.com.
4. On the next form (headed, "Hi <name>"), click "Forgot password?".
5. Follow the password recovery process. It will send a link to your personal email address.
6. Follow that link and set a new password.
7. Set up 2FA immediately.
8. Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=hack-team-hack-o-holics.

You have an "infrastructure SA" (infrastructure@hack-team-hack-o-holics.iam.gserviceaccount.com) with the same IAM permissions as team members.
You can authenticate as it from a GitHub Actions workflow anywhere in this repo using the Workload Identity Federation method of [Google's auth action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)
and run gcloud commands using [Google's setup-gcloud Action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud).
There's an example workflow in your repo to start you off.
This SA is also used when you provision infrastructure using your Terraform Cloud workspace.

You have a "workload SA" (workload@hack-team-hack-o-holics.iam.gserviceaccount.com) that you can use to attach to your workloads (e.g. Cloud Run revisions).
The default SAs have been de-privileged.
The workload SA has the following roles granted at project level:
* roles/aiplatform.user
* roles/artifactregistry.createOnPushWriter
* roles/automl.predictor
* roles/bigquery.connectionUser
* roles/bigquery.dataViewer
* roles/bigquery.filteredDataViewer
* roles/bigquery.jobUser
* roles/bigquery.readSessionUser
* roles/bigquerydatapolicy.maskedReader
* roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder
* roles/cloudbuild.tokenAccessor
* roles/cloudbuild.workerPoolUser
* roles/cloudfunctions.invoker
* roles/cloudsql.client
* roles/cloudsql.instanceUser
* roles/cloudtranslate.user
* roles/composer.worker
* roles/contactcenteraiplatform.viewer
* roles/contactcenterinsights.viewer
* roles/dataflow.admin
* roles/dataflow.worker
* roles/dataproc.hubAgent

* roles/documentai.apiUser
* roles/errorreporting.writer
* roles/logging.logWriter
* roles/monitoring.metricWriter
* roles/notebooks.runner
* roles/pubsub.publisher
* roles/pubsub.subscriber
* roles/run.invoker
* roles/servicemanagement.quotaViewer

* roles/speech.client
* roles/storage.objectViewer
* roles/storagetransfer.transferAgent
* roles/storagetransfer.user
* roles/visionai.admin
* roles/workflows.invoker

### Limitations & Restrictions
* You have a budget of EUR ~700.
Your team lead will receive notifications when your actual or forecast spend passes 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% and 100%. If you are the team lead please cascade this information to your fellow team members.
Your project will be torn down if you approach 100% or if you are spending rapidly. 
* Fairly severe quotas are in place to help manage the above.
Talk to the happy hackathon helpers if this is impeding your idea.
* The default compute SA in your project has been de-privileged.
Whenever you provision compute (e.g. a VMs powering a Jupyter notebook or dataflow pipeline, a Cloud Run service or a Cloud Function) 
you must attach the Workload SA, usually referred to in the GCP documentation as "attaching a custom SA".
* You cannot create services accounts.
  * Use your infrastructure SA to interact with GCP from GitHub.
  * Use your workload SA to power your workloads.
* You cannot create or upload service account keys.
  * Use your own interactive access or Workload Identity Federation from GitHub Actions workflows instead.

### Developing in Google Cloud Console & Cloud Shell
Built into the Google Cloud Console is a Shell & Editor. Google Cloud Shell is already provisioned with a lot of the standard development tools including:
- Git
- Kubeclt
- Docker 
- Helm 
- Terraform
- gcloud cli 
- & more.

To access cloud shell simply Click the Cloud Shell Icon in the top right hand corner of your Cloud Console Window.
</br>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/db-hack23-readme-assets/readme-001-activate-cloud-shell.png"
     alt="Activate Cloud Shell"
     style="max-height: 230px; float:center" />
</br></br>
Cloud Shell will activate at the bottom of your Cloud Console window. You can also access the inbuilt IDE for code development and Git access ect by clicking the ```Open Eiditor``` button from within Cloud Shell.
</br>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/db-hack23-readme-assets/readme-002-cloud-shell.png"
     alt="Activate Cloud Shell amd IDE"
     style="max-height: 230px; float:center" />

From here you could easily clone your team's GitHub repositories and start iterating on your hackathon solution. 

**Setting up Cloud Shell for Development**
Simply run the following commands to Auth your cloud shell against your Google Cloud Account. 

1. Simply run ```gcloud auth login``` and follow the prompts to complete Oauth2 Auth from Cloud Shell to your Cloud Project.
2. Configure your default Cloud Shell Google Cloud Project by running ```gcloud config set project hack-team-hack-o-holics```

If you modify them, your changes may be overwritten.
* We have a hard limit of 50,000 GitHub Actions minutes for the whole hackathon.
We request heavy user consider offloading what they can to Cloud Build instead
* We have a hard limit of 50GB of GitHub Actions and Packages storage for the whole hackathon.
  * If you produce very large GitHub Actions logs, please clean them up in a timely manner.
  * If you want to publish container images, please use GCP Artifact Registry.
  * For other artefacts, consider using Cloud Storage.

## [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/db-hackathon-2023/workspaces/hack-team-hack-o-holics)
Your Terraform Cloud workspace is VCS-backed by this GitHub repository.
Pushing files to the "terraform" directory of this repo will automatically trigger a plan/apply cycle in TFC 
using the contents of that directory as the root module.

The workspace has been pre-configured so that the google and google-beta providers will authenticate using your infrastructure SA 
and default to creating resources in your project.

A set of useful [Input variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables) have been populated for you:
* infra_sa_email - The email address representation of the SA you can use to deploy infrastructure. It has the same access rights as human team members.: infrastructure@hack-team-hack-o-holics.iam.gserviceaccount.com

## OpenShift (XXX)
### Interactive Access
Log in to OpenShift via https://console-openshift-console.apps.dbh.dbhackathon.org/.
No SSL cert has been provisioned, so you'll have to risk the warnings.
On that page, choose to "Log in with" the "githubidp" option and use the GitHub handle you signed up with to complete the authentication.
